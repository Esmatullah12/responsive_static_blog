            <h2>My name is Esmat and living the simple life sace my life</h2>

            <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought 
            that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
            too much.</p>
            <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was on the verge of breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage. sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment and I quit my job</p>

            <p>It wasn't ease at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked</p>
            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around. <strong>I flelt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>
            and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
